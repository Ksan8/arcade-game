## Description
This was completed as a project within [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s  [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1) program.

A slightly more modern version of Frogger, this is a minimalist 2D game in which the object is to make it to the water without colliding into evil enemy bugs.

### How to View This Page
Clone or download this repository, then open _index.html_ in your browser after starting a simple web server.

The easiest way is to use SimpleHTTPServer if you already have Python installed (it comes pre-installed on most Mac OS X and Linux computers). In a terminal window, cd into the downloaded directory and run the following command:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

After it starts, you can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html in your preferred browser.

## Controls
Use left-right and up-down arrow keys to move the player from block to block. Collision with enemy results in death and reduced score, while reaching the water is counted toward a positive score.
