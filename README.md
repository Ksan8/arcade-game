## Description
A slightly more modern version of Frogger, this is a minimalist 2D game in which the object is to make it to the water without colliding into evil enemy bugs.

## Controls
Use left-right and up-down arrow keys to move the player from block to block. Enemy collision results in death and reduced score, while reaching the water is counted toward a positive score.

## Contributing
This is open-source code; feel free to fork it and play around.
